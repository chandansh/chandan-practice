 * What is Observer design Pattern?
 Observer design pattern in Java Code ExampleObserver design pattern in Java is very important pattern and 
 as name suggest it’s used to observe things. Suppose you want to notify for change in a particular object 
 than you observer that object and changes are notified to you. Object which is being observed is refereed 
 as Subject and classes which observe subject are called Observer. This is beautiful pattern and used heavily 
 along with Model View Controller Design pattern where change in model is propagated to view so that it can
 render it with modified information. Observer pattern is also a very popular Java interview questions and 
 mostly asked on Senior or mid senior level.

 Problem which is solved by Observer Pattern:

 If we have requirement that if particular object change its state and on depending upon
 This changes some or group of objects automatically change their state we need to implement observer pattern 
 it will reduce coupling between objects.
 In real world if try to find example see when we subscribe for New Phone connection whenever customer is 
 registered with that company all other departments are notified accordingly and then depending upon the state the 
 do their jobs like do the verification of their address then if customer state is verified then dispatch the welcome
 kit etc.



 How Observer Design Pattern is implemented in Java;

 For implementation of this pattern java makes our task very easy, developer need not to do so much for implementing
 this pattern .In java.util package we can find interfaces ,classes and methods for implementing this pattern.

 Public Interface Observer:

 Any class who implements this interface must be notified when subject or observable object change its status.

 Update (Observable Ob, Object arg): This method is called when subject is changed.


 Class Observable:
 It’s a subject to whom observer wants to observe.


 Some Important Method:
 addObserver(Observer o):add Observers in the set of observers for this subject or observalbel object.

 deleteObserver(Observer o): delete Observers in the set of observers .

 hasChanged():check if object has changed.

 clearChanged():this method will indicate that subject has no changes or all the observers has been notified when 
 changes is made.

 notifyObservers(): notify all the observers if object has changed .


 Code Example of Observer design pattern in Java:
 Observer Design pattern is generic than how it is implemented in Java. You are free to choose java.util.Observable 
 or java.util.Observer or writing your own Subject and Observer interface. I prefer having my own Subject and Observer 
 interface and this is how I am going to write my Code Example of Observer design Pattern in java. Mine Example is 
 very Simple you have a Loan on which interest rate is subject to change and when it changes, Loan notifies to Newspaper 
 or Internet media to display new loan interest rate. To implement this we have a Subject interface which contains methods
 for adding, removing and notifying Observers and an Observer interface which contains update(int interest) method which
 will be called by Subject implementation when interest rate changes.
