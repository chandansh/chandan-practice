/**
 * The implementation of the my order local service.
 *
 * <p>
 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link com.mpower.training.order.service.MyOrderLocalService} interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.mpower.training.order.service.MyOrderLocalServiceUtil} to access the my order local service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
