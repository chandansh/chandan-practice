/**
 * The model interface for the MyOrder service. Represents a row in the &quot;myOrder_training_MyOrder&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.mpower.training.order.model.impl.MyOrderImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a my order model instance should use the {@link MyOrder} interface instead.
