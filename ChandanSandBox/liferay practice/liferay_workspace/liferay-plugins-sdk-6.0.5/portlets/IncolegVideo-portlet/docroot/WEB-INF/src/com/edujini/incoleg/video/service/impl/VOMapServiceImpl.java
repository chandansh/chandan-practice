 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.edujini.incoleg.video.service.VOMapServiceUtil} to access the v o map remote service.

 *
 * <p>
 * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
