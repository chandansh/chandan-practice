 * The model interface for the StoreSettings service. Represents a row in the &quot;video_StoreSettings&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.edujini.incoleg.video.model.impl.StoreSettingsImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a store settings model instance should use the {@link StoreSettings} interface instead.
