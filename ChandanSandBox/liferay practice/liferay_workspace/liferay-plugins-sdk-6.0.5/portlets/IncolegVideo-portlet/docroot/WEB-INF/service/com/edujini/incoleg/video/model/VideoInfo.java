/**
 * The model interface for the VideoInfo service. Represents a row in the &quot;video_VideoInfo&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.edujini.incoleg.video.model.impl.VideoInfoImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a video info model instance should use the {@link VideoInfo} interface instead.
