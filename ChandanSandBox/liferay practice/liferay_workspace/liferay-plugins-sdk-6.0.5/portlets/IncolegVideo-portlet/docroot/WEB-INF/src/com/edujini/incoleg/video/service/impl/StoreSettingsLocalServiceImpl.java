 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.edujini.incoleg.video.service.StoreSettingsLocalServiceUtil} to access the store settings local service.

 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
